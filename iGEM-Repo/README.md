## Introduction
Here we mainly used a key program: Applied_Bayesian_Optimization.ipynb (Also, you may write it as a .py format program).

### The input :  
1. **Initial Experimental result** using given fixed-dimensional (1-5, normally) initial independent variables.  
2. **Number of iterations**, this depends on how many vc are you willing to spend to get a relatively optimal solution.  
3. **Experimental result every iteration round** using possible global optimal coefficients so far, input the result corresponding to those coefs.  
### The Output :
1. **Current global optimal solution** after every iteration round.
2. **Global optimal solution** among the whole experiments you did so far.
